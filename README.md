# BlogProject

In this project, which I have developed as a block site, there are two separate user logins with different privileges as admin and author. By logging in as an author, you can change your user information and share new articles. With the admin login, you can access all categories, add new categories and delete them.

I developed my project in 4 basic layers: Business, Entity, Data Access and Presentation and with .Net Mvc5, one of the current development topics of the industry. I used MSSQL as a database in my project and when I moved to the server, I worked on a server with windows hosting support. On the front end of the project, I realized the design side by including Html5, Css, Bootsrap, Javascript, Jquery components.
